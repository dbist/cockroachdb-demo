-- What Is the “Transaction” Actually Performed in pgbench?
-- If you select the simple-update built-in (also -N), steps 4 and 5 aren't included in the transaction. This will avoid update contention on these tables, but it makes the test case even less like TPC-B.
-- If you select the select-only built-in (also -S), only the SELECT is issued.
